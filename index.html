    	<h3>About</h3>
    	<p>This is the home page of my site. It is an attempt to create a site with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Iâ€™m not familiar with those tools but they seem quite interesting to be honest!</p>
    	<br>
    	<h3>What you will find in this page</h3>
    	<p>This site is created specifically for my Curriculum Vitae (CV).</p>
